      <p class="hm">Electricity production in India is a complex and diverse system that involves multiple sources of energy, including thermal, hydro, nuclear, renewable, and non-renewable sources. The power sector in India is a critical component of the country's infrastructure, playing a crucial role in supporting economic growth, providing energy access to all citizens, and addressing environmental concerns.</p>
    <h2>Here are some key points about electricity production in India:-</h2>

    <ul>
        <h3>Thermal Electricity Plant</h3>
        <li style="display: block;"><p><img src="media/th.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 10px; border-radius: 20px;" width="30%" alt="">Thermal power plants, also known as fossil fuel power plants, are a significant source of electricity production globally. These power plants generate electricity by burning fossil fuels, such as coal, natural gas, and oil, to produce heat, which is then used to generate steam and drive turbines that produce electricity. However, thermal power plants are associated with environmental concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and waste disposal.</p></li><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <h3>Hydroelectric power Plant</h3>
        <li style="display: block;"><p><img src="media/he.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 10px; border-radius: 20px;" width="30%" alt="">Hydropower, which involves generating electricity by harnessing the kinetic and potential energy of moving water, is one of the oldest and most widely used forms of renewable energy. It accounts for a significant portion of global electricity production.Hydropower is a significant source of electricity production worldwide, accounting for a substantial portion of global electricity generation. It has both benefits and challenges, and its future outlook will depend on various factors, including technological advancements, environmental considerations, and social impacts.</p></li><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <h3>Nuclear power Plant</h3>
        <li style="display: block;"><p><img src="media/ne.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 10px; border-radius: 20px;" width="30%" alt=""> Nuclear power plants generate electricity through a process called nuclear fission, which involves splitting atoms of radioactive materials, such as uranium or plutonium, in a controlled manner. The heat produced from the nuclear fission reactions is used to generate steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity.</p></li><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <h3>Renewable energy</h3>
        <li style="display: block;"><p><img src="media/re.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 10px; border-radius: 20px;" width="30%" alt=""> Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydropower, biomass, and geothermal, are gaining increasing prominence in the global electricity production mix. These sources are considered sustainable as they are naturally replenished and have lower or no greenhouse gas emissions. Many countries have been investing in renewable energy infrastructure and implementing policies to promote their adoption in order to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change.</p></li><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <h3>Non-renewable sources</h3>
        <li style="display: block;"><p><img src="media/nre.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 10px; border-radius: 20px;" width="30%" alt="">Historically, fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, and oil have been the dominant sources of electricity production worldwide. These fuels are burned to generate heat, which is then used to produce steam to drive turbines and generate electricity. However, the use of fossil fuels has raised concerns about environmental pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and their contribution to climate change.</p></li>

    <center><p>The electricity production mix varies across different countries and regions, with some relying heavily on fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, and oil, while others have shifted towards renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydropower, and nuclear power. In recent years, there has been a growing global trend towards renewable energy sources as countries aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change.It's important to note that the global electricity production is dynamic and subject to change as countries continue to adopt different energy policies, invest in renewable energy infrastructure, and implement innovative technologies to meet their energy needs. For the most up-to-date and accurate information on global electricity production, it's recommended to refer to official sources such as the IEA, World Bank, and national energy agencies.</p></center>
